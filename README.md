Deployed on Mantle Sepolia Testnet: https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz/address/0x15A734df32E7b74EA7d16d52c65908989a327D1D
## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with this app, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/kinghonest45/Mantle_defi_pet
cd Mantle_defi_pet
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

## Future Ideas
- Introduce customizable options for a variety of pets.
- Add unique animations for each pet to enhance user engagement.
- Display the last feeding time and incorporate a feature where pets can potentially die if not fed, introducing a hunger mechanic.
- Implement a leveling system where pets start as babies (e.g., a puppy) and grow over time, reaching new stages of development (e.g., after 5-10 days of regular feeding, the pet matures).
- Add the ability to transfer pet ownership temporarily/permanently, allowing others to take care of pets if the owner is unavailable to feed them.
